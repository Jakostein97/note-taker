# Note Taker 

## Description

This is a simple web application for taking and managing notes. It allows users to create new notes, view existing notes, and delete notes. The application utilizes Express.js for the server-side logic and interacts with a JSON file (db.json) to persist note data. On the client-side, it uses vanilla JavaScript to handle user interactions and update the UI dynamically.
